    A programme designed to receive dicom data consisting of prostate 
    ultrasound containing contouring information. The programme is then 
    designed to analyse the contour information to localize the biopsy 
    contours relative to the DIL and prostate contours. This version 
    of the programme does not rely on the structure of the data folder,
    all data may simply be dumped into the data folder, in whatever structure
    the analyzer would like. The programme relies solely on the dicom
    meta-data to identify patients, treatments and dicom type. At present, 
    it only requires that there exist a folder called Data, located two levels 
    above this file.
